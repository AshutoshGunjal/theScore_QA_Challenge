**theScore QA Automation Challenge**

This framework aims to offer an automated solution for streamlining the business processes of theScore. 
- To create a universal solution that can work across various platforms, we've chosen the Appium tool. 
- To implement a behavior-driven approach, we've opted for Cucumber, which enhances reusability and simplicity. 
- In accordance with the project's needs, we've adopted the Page Object Model, which involves building an inheritance-based hierarchy for page objects. This enables us to load page objects on demand for versatile usage in our business processes.

Technical Requirements:

> - Maven
> - Cucumber Plugin
> - JDK 11
> - A connected mobile device or a virtual device
> - Appium
